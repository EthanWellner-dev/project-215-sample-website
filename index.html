                        <p class="lead overview-font ovPadLeft">Novel black-box adversarials pose a significant vulnerability to the security of neural networks (NN), as they are realistically possible, and can be taken advantage of in high-stakes situations like driving. Many studies investigate white-box adversarials, though they rely on highly sensitive data and aren’t realistically possible in most situations. This research investigates the potential security risk of a novel black-box adversarial, based on altering random pixels, and whether introducing additional adversarial images into the sample data is a viable fix. Two different types of blackbox adversarials were used in testing and training. The study found that the adversarial could decrease the accuracy of both adversarial-trained and control neural networks, reducing the adversarial-trained neural network’s accuracy more significantly. Additionally, when the adversarial was tested on open-source neural networks, they were able to completely change the prediction. This study reveals a significant and realistic vulnerability in neural networks.

                        <p class="lead overview-font ovPadRight">With the knowledge gained from this research, those with an AI model can better understand the threat posed to them by not having proper protection against novel adversarial attacks. As the threat of adversarial attacks on AI grows, an understanding of the possible threat is important to build the appropriate responses and defenses. As new adversarial methods arise, a back-and-forth game of cybersecurity in adversarial ML models may become a reality, reminiscent of modern hacking, knowing what losing can have in store can change the development of AI. The threat of causing AI to mislabel objects in a high-danger scenario like self-driving vehicles can cause a massive cybersecurity threat.

                        <p class="lead overview-font ovPadLeft"> The hypothesis was that because random pixels can lead to a different input layer, the delicate manner of the ML AI may cause inaccuracies, with a higher chance of this happening with more of this adversarial, causing differences in the accuracies of both as more of the image was deleted. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the accuracies as more of the image was covered. It was predicted that training the AIs with the adversarial would cause the accuracy of the AIs when tested against adversarials. This study aimed to examine the risk of having a novel ML model mislabel intentionally manipulated images, and a potential defense against those manipulated images.
